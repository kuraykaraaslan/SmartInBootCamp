# System Developer BootCamp Repository

Welcome to my System Developer BootCamp repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of all the projects and practice exercises undertaken during my System Developer BootCamp journey. As I progress through the program, each project and practice session is meticulously organized into dedicated folders within this repository.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase my learning journey, track progress, and serve as a reference for both personal review and potential collaboration. By maintaining a centralized repository, I aim to create a streamlined and easily navigable archive of my coding endeavors.

## Practice Exercises

Daily practice exercises are organized chronologically:

## Day One

The first day of the bootcamp was dedicated to learning about culture, the company, and the team. No practice exercises were completed on this day.

## Day Two
- [Hosts File Editor](https://github.com/kuraykaraaslan/SystemDeveloperBootcamp/blob/main/DayTwoHostsFileEditor)

## Day Three
- [Check Anagram](https://github.com/kuraykaraaslan/SystemDeveloperBootcamp/blob/main/DayThreeCheckAnagram)

Detailed instructions on how to explore each project or practice exercise are provided within the corresponding folders. This includes setup guidelines, dependencies, and any additional information necessary for a smooth experience.
